# Termyy
Move around freely in the terminal-rendered square.

## Info
Development lasted from 2018-04-26 to 2018-05-26 with few breaks. Refactored 
a little in late 2019. Whole rendering was written in the clear Python 3 -
without curses/ncurses modules. Generally the implementation is a little ugly.

## System requirements
Your computer must have *nix and the Python 3 installed. You need also
a terminal with size >= 80x24 chars. Linux or even *nix (not tested).

## Gameplay
To run type: "./termyy.py". Keymap is very intuitive: 'w', 's', 'a', 'd' as
arrows and SHIFT+P to pause.
